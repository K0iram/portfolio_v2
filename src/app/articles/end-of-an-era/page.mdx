In the tech world, where the only constant is change, I recently found myself navigating through an unexpected turn in my journey. The closure of Blueboard, a company to which I dedicated my heart and soul, has left me, along with many others, standing at a crossroads, filled with a whirlwind of emotions.

## The Shockwave Through My Core

When I joined Blueboard, I was captivated by its noble mission to acknowledge and appreciate employees by gifting them memorable experiences. I wholeheartedly believed in this mission, dedicating myself to every line of code, project, and team interaction. Yet, despite our collective dedication, the company's abrupt end came as a shockwave, leaving a void where once there was the promise of innovation and appreciation.

## Mixed Emotions Amidst the Rubble

It's hard to describe the cocktail of feelings that ensued following the announcement made by our CFO, Scott Broomfield. His [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/scottbroomfield_to-our-blueboard-customers-im-very-sad-activity-7173533065934303232-4cmt), detailing the "unforeseen" foreclosure by our lender and the immediate end of operations, painted a grim picture of our final moments. The news was a testament to the fragile nature of our industry, where the rug can be pulled from under us without a moment's notice.

The sadness that envelops me is palpable, not just because of the loss of a job but also because of the disintegration of a community that believed in making a difference. Yet, amidst the sorrow, my determination only grows stronger, driving me to seek new opportunities to make a difference, learn, and evolve.

## The Frustration with Unfulfilled Promises

My frustration isn't just with the loss but with how it unfolded. Blueboard's promise was to create bonds through experiences, yet in its final act, it seemed to forget the very essence of its mission. The manner in which the employees, the backbone of any company, were left in the dark until the very end speaks volumes of the disconnect between lofty ideals and reality.

It's disheartening to realize that the management, perhaps, didn't see the end coming, or if they did, chose to navigate through it in silence, leaving many of us unprepared for the immediate aftermath. It's a harsh reminder of the volatility of the tech industry, where careers can be built and dismantled overnight.

## Remorse for My Fellow Blueboarders

My heart goes out to every employee, customer, and vendor affected by Blueboard's closure. We were a family bound by a shared vision and a passion for creating unforgettable experiences. Seeing such a vibrant community disbanded, witnessing dreams being deferred, and knowing the uncertainty ahead for many is extremely saddening.

## The Path Forward: Resilience in Adversity

This moment of reflection steers me towards focusing on the potential for growth and learning from this experience. The closure of Blueboard marks not an end but a pivot point in my professional journey. With the lessons learned and the relationships built, I'm ready to invest my passion and skills into a new venture that aligns with my values.

To my fellow Blueboarders and all who are navigating this change, let's view this not as an end but an opportunity for new beginnings. Our shared experiences have created a foundation to serve us well as we move into new ventures.

As we face this change, we do so with resilience, ready for the next chapter. I'm optimistic about the future and the opportunities it holds.
